This R package wraps a small C++ library that uses expectation propagation to calculate a variational approximation to the likelihood of the phylogenetic threshold model.

For examples of use, see the functions `testcase_continuous()` (for continuous traits), `testcase_categorical()` (for binary traits), and `testcase_mixed()` (for mixed continuous-binary traits).
